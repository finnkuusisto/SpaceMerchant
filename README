SpaceMerchant is a program I wrote to serve as an assignment for students while I
was an instructor for CS-302 at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  The goal
of the assignment was to improve understanding of OOP.  The students were given
javadocs and code skeletons (only method headers) for most of the classes and
they were expected to complete the program.

*Please send me a note if you plan to make use of any of this code*

The program itself is a text adventure that allows the player to explore a game
world, traveling from location to location, buying and selling commodities.  In
addition to this aspect, players must manage ship fuel, ship cargo capacity and
complete missions.  The game is complete when the player completes all the
missions.  One of the best aspects of the game is that each game world is
specified in a single text file with a fairly simple format.  This allows the
player to create worlds of their own to explore.

I don't currently plan to provide any more documentation for the program than is
present in the code. I can probably provide some minimal further assistance in
understanding the code if you plan to use it for anything.
